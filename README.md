Strum's Mental VCV Module Suite

strum@softhome.net

Simple but useful modules for VCVRack

Version : 0.0.1

Based largely on the fundamental modules but I have also used some code from other module
developers and learned various ways of doing things from the other suites of modules as well.

The modules are mostly utilities, which you can never have enough of, and I have
focused on keeping them small to pack a lot of functionality into as little possible screen area.

Currently Compiles against the lastest code as of 1 Oct 2017.
